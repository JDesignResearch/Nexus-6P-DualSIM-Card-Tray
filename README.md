# Nexus-6P-DualSIM-Card-Tray
The attached design is a dual sim tray for the Google Huawei Nexus 6P.

Consider a 5$ donation to my patreon @ patreon.com/jdr to cover the design work involved! 5$ is equivalent to 60% of the cost of a market price replacement sim card tray. This should cover the engineering work involved!
